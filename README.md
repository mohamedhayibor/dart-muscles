A playground to grow your Dart muscles. For better effects, get something working before looking at the solution. Most likely yours will be different than mine so I will merge it in as a way 2 or 3...

#### A function that takes a string, then swaps the case (upper/lower) for each letter.

[solution](https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/dart-muscles/blob/master/solutions/swapLowerUpperCase.dart)

#### A function that takes an array and a function then returns true if the function returns true for all items in the array

[solution](https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/dart-muscles/blob/master/solutions/truePredicateForAll.dart)

#### A function that takes a string then outputs an array containing all the words and their lengths
> ex: addLength('you will win') => ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"]

[solution](https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/dart-muscles/blob/master/solutions/getLengthForEveryWord.dart)

#### A function that takes an array containing numbers then returns the sum of the numbers in the array 

[solution](https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/dart-muscles/blob/master/solutions/sumAllElementsInArray.dart)

#### A function that takes a string and a number (n) that returns a string that repeats the initial string (n) number of times.

[solution](https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/dart-muscles/blob/master/solutions/repeatItAgain.dart)
